**Convert a text collection with 1095 news documents into tf-idf vectors:**
1. Construct a dictionary based on the terms extracted from the given documents.
> *Record the document frequency of each term.

2. Transfer each document into a tf-idf unit vector
3. Write a function cosine(Docx, Docy) which loads the tf-idf vectors of documents x and y and returns their cosine similarity.
